      <p class='intro'>one of the most interesting topics for me is researching the ways of depicting feelings in digital environment. </p>
      <p class='intro'>it does not contain the human footprint as much as other media do, because the main feature of digital world is universalizing its content. in paintings, sculptures, photography, etc. there are a lot of factors (paint stains, dust on film, scars and else) that make the artwork unique and help depicting irrational feelings, but websites are meant to be ideal, structurised and fully rational. they are just rows and columns of standartised data.</p>
      <p class='intro'>i am trying to enbody this structure with vital irratinality and pure feelings. to do so we must drop all the obvious forms like pictures and text and leave space for viewersâ€™ imagination.</p>
      <p class='intro'>you will see a website devoid of familiar meaningful signs by transitioning to abstaction, as pure colors and forms are the most accurate in depicting feelings.</p>
      <p class='intro'>all the navigation is based on your intuition.</p>
      <p class='intro'>enjoy!</p>
